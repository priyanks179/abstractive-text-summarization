tehran , iran -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- iran 's defense minister rejected u.s. allegations that the country was helping insurgents in neighboring iraq , saying wednesday that such `` baseless claims '' demonstrate u.s. failure in the middle eastern country . brigadier general ahmad vahidi 's comments were reported by the semiofficial fars news agency . vahidi said the united states was trying to sow discord among the countries in the region . his comments came after u.s. defense secretary leon panetta became the latest u.s. official to reiterate that iraq needs to crack down on armed factions that have been targeting u.s. troops with iranian-supplied weapons . `` we are very concerned about iran and weapons they are providing to extremists here in iraq , and the reality is that we 've seen the results of that , '' panetta told troops in baghdad monday . `` in june , we lost a hell of a lot of americans . '' the u.s. force of 46,000 has come under increased attacks in recent weeks . earlier this month , joint chiefs chairman adm. mike mullen said any potential agreement with iraq for u.s. forces to stay on beyond the end-of-the-year deadline must confront the issue of iranian involvement . `` iran is playing an out-sized role right now , '' mullen said . `` iran is very directly supporting extremist shia groups -lrb- in iraq -rrb- , which are killing our troops . '' he added that iran had made a decision in 2008 to scale back its involvement in iraq but had recently stepped up its activities , possibly so it could claim credit for the american withdrawal . tehran has said washington , with its accusations , is trying to project the blame for u.s. troop deaths elsewhere .:==:iran 's defense minister says the u.s. is trying to sow discord in the region . panetta : `` we are very concerned about iran and weapons they are providing '' . if iraq wants u.s. forces to stay , it must confront iran 's involvement , mullen says . tehran says washington is trying to project blame for troop deaths elsewhere .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- armed men attacked a displaced persons camp in the eastern democratic republic of congo early sunday , raping women and looting at a facility where tens of thousands of people have taken refuge , a u.n. official said . simplice kpandji , a spokesman for the united nations ' refugee agency , said it was unclear whether anyone had been killed at the camp , which is about 10 kilometers from goma , the border city that has been a flashpoint for fighting between government troops and the m23 rebel group . the mugunga iii camp houses more than 30,000 displaced people , many of whom fled to the camp when rebels advanced on goma , kpandji said . the attackers ' identity was unknown , he said , and officials were working on gathering more information . word of the attack came as u.n. monitors confirmed that rebels had withdrawn from goma , more than a week after they seized the city from government forces . fighters from the m23 rebel group boarded trucks and other vehicles to head north to outside of the 20 kilometer buffer zone stipulated by regional leaders , u.n. peacekeepers in congo said in a statement . earlier they had begun leaving sake , a town to the west of goma . m23 rebels also left their posts at the border crossing with rwanda . tensions mounted in goma as several disputes arose . the m23 wanted to take a large cache of ammunition left by fleeing congolese soldiers , according to a reporter on the ground who was not named for his safety . the u.n. peacekeeping prevented the rebels from doing so , and also stopped the rebels from taking vehicles donated to the government by the european union , the reporter said . the rebel group has been accused of widespread looting by the united nations and goma residents . government forces also looted as they fled last week , witnesses said . the united nations welcomed m23 's move , but said the group must cease military activity and stay outside of goma . `` we welcome this withdrawal , but emphasize that this is an early step and that stability in the region remains very fragile , '' said kieran dwyer , spokesperson for u.n. peacekeepers . regional leaders and the african union had called for the rebels ' withdrawal from goma , supposed to have been completed by thursday , as a condition of starting negotiations . the regional leaders ' plan foresees an integrated force being deployed for an initial period of three months at goma airport , ugandan gen. aronda nyakairima said earlier this week . it would include a 100-strong neutral force , which would be in command , 100 troops from the congolese army , and 100 members of the m23 , nyakairima said . two military observers would also be deployed from each of the neighboring regional powers , while monusco would be responsible for securing the buffer zone outside goma , he said . the regional leaders also called on the rebels to `` stop all war activities , '' and `` stop talk of overthrowing an elected government . '' the latest violence has forced more than 140,000 people to flee their homes , according to the u.n. refugee agency , on top of those already forced from their homes by previous rounds of fighting in the volatile region . and aid groups warn the conflict risks triggering a broader humanitarian crisis . why congo needs our help the m23 group was named for a peace deal of march 23 , 2009 , which it accuses the government of violating . the soldiers , mostly tutsis , became part of the national army through that accord . however , they broke away from the congolese army in april , complaining they were n't being promoted as promised , and because of a lack of pay and poor conditions . the latest unrest continues a cycle of misery in eastern dr congo , a mineral-rich region at the epicenter of political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east , uganda and rwanda . the area has been embroiled in violence since 1994 , when hutu forces crossed the border from rwanda fearing reprisals after the genocide in that country . why the world is ignoring congo war:==:it is unclear whether anyone was killed in the attack , a u.n. official says . attackers looted a displaced persons camp and raped women there , the official says . the attack comes after u.n. monitors confirm that rebels have withdrawn from goma . the rebels were told by regional leaders to withdraw at least 12 miles from the city .

at least 14 people , including a general , were killed thursday when a ukrainian military helicopter was shot down by `` terrorists '' near slovyansk , acting president oleksandr turchynov told parliament . turchynov said the chopper , which was carrying soldiers for a troop rotation , was shot down with a russian rocket-propelled grenade launcher . militants in the rebel stronghold claimed responsibility for downing the helicopter , a spokesman for the militants said . the aircraft had flown there from kramatorsk , he said , where the ukrainian military has a substantial presence . the large loss of life will be a major blow to the ukrainian military , which on monday toughened its approach to the separatist movement when it launched a fierce assault on militants who 'd taken control of part of donetsk airport . also in slovyansk , the self-declared mayor said pro-russia separatist militants are holding four european observers who have been missing since monday . but he declined to say where . `` our militants got them , '' vyacheslav ponomarev said thursday . `` they were detained because they did n't respect my request . i asked them not to leave donetsk -lrb- city -rrb- . they decided they were smarter and could come here . '' ponomarev added that the monitors from the organization for security and co-operation in europe were not being held in the town . they also are not `` exchange material , '' he said , indicating that they were not being held to swap for separatists detained by kiev authorities . ponomarev said he had been in contact with the osce , and they were assessing the situation . he said he would probably release the monitors soon but would n't say when . on wednesday , ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman yevhen perebynis said that a pro-russia group was holding the monitors and that negotiations for their release were `` in process . '' the four team members , who are swiss , turkish , estonian and danish , were on a routine patrol monday east of donetsk city when last heard from , according to the osce . the last time an osce team went missing in the donetsk region , its members also turned up in the hands of the militant separatists in slovyansk and were described by ponomarev as `` prisoners of war . '' they were freed just over a week later . there were fears wednesday for the safety of another group of 11 monitors who went missing after being stopped at a roadblock in marinka , west of donetsk city , but the group later re-established contact with the osce . the osce said thursday that the 11 had been abducted for seven hours by a dozen-strong armed group but were released . separatists : bodies to be returned to russia dozens of pro-russia separatists were killed after ukrainian security forces launched their assault on donetsk international airport on monday , following the militants ' seizure of a terminal . the military 's move -- only hours after president-elect petro poroshenko declared his election win -- was interpreted by some as an indication that he will take a tougher stance as he seeks to unify the country . now , the grim task of returning the dead to their families is under way . at least 33 russian citizens are among the militants killed during the violence , a spokesman for the self-declared donetsk people 's republic told a cnn team at the morgue . the bodies have been identified , and there is an agreement with the local police to escort the remains back to russia soon , several separatist representatives said . the bodies will be taken across the border to the southwestern russian city of rostov-on-don . from there , they will be transported to different cities according to where they are from , reportedly including moscow and grozny in the russian republic of chechnya . the cnn team at the morgue in donetsk city saw at least 10 coffins . the separatist spokesman at the morgue said the men were volunteers from across russia who had come to help stand with the separatists against the authorities in kiev . the spokesman also said that there are still about 15 bodies left at the airport that the separatists have n't been able to collect or identify . about 20 of those killed are ukrainian , he said . the donetsk mayor 's official website put the airport death toll at 40 tuesday , including two civilians , but did not specify how many were separatists . but the separatist spokesman said the death toll could be as high as 70 . if confirmed , this would make monday the deadliest day in ukraine since the bloody clashes in kiev 's independence square , or maidan , which triggered the ouster of pro-moscow president viktor yanukovych in february and led to the current spiral into violence in the east . the separatists have until now insisted that their movement is homegrown , so their very public acknowledgment of so many russian citizens among those killed monday marks a shift in approach . it could be intended to goad moscow into a response at a time when the separatist movement is under pressure to find a way forward and has shown signs of division within its ranks . kiev and the west have accused russia of coordinating and supplying the separatists , a claim moscow has denied . russia has said it will respect sunday 's election results . on thursday , a u.s. official with direct knowledge of the latest intelligence said 30,000 russian troops that had been amassed along the russia-ukraine border have been moving back to their home bases over the last several days . about 10,000 troops -- mainly infantry -- remain along russia 's border with eastern ukraine , the official said , and there are some signs those troops will be pulling back as well . nato this week also reported signs that some russian troops near ukraine 's eastern border may be preparing to pull back . the united states has been using satellites to track russian troop movements for weeks , and both the united states and nato have released imagery to bolster their case that russia had amassed tens of thousands of troops along the border . several u.s. officials have said it appears the russians have decided to try to work with the new ukrainian government , but officials also point out that it would n't take much to bring a large number of russian forces back to the border via transport aircraft at any time . governor in talks with separatists serhiy taruta , the billionaire governor of donetsk , acknowledged in a cnn interview in kiev that a ukrainian military operation was under way in the donetsk region , but he was unable to comment further . taruta said he was in talks with pro-russia separatist leaders in the region to try to calm the situation , adding that the aim was to `` reach real understanding , '' rather than just a deal . `` we are having dialogue , which is dragging out because they seem to have a constant rotation of their leaders , but i hope that in the final analysis we will reach an agreement and reconciliation to work together , '' he said . taruta has met with poroshenko in kiev , he said , adding that the president-elect will visit the donetsk region `` we hope in the first half of june . '' meanwhile , a spokeswoman for the donetsk people 's republic said that some barricades were being cleared away from in front of the regional administration building in donetsk city that the separatists have made their headquarters for weeks . she said that separatists were `` cleaning up '' and `` instilling order '' and that a news conference would soon explain more . earlier , militants surrounded the building and said they were searching it for looters but explained little more . russia and ukraine bicker in u.n. meeting clashes in eastern luhansk amid the ongoing tensions , ukraine 's national guard base in the eastern luhansk region was attacked wednesday by what the country 's interior ministry described as `` terrorists . '' `` there have been losses among military personnel as well as among the attackers , '' a statement from the ministry said . the luhansk region is , with neighboring donetsk , at the heart of the separatists ' bid to declare independence from ukraine . eastern ukraine was a key support base for yanukovych , and many people there oppose the authorities in kiev , favoring closer ties instead to russia . ukraine : fierce fighting closes donetsk airport , claims dozens of lives opinion : free elections good for ukraine , but could be bad for putin:==:u.s. official : tens of thousands of russian troops along border have been moving back . acting president says russian grenade launcher downed helicopter . donetsk governor says he is in talks with separatist leaders , aims to calm situation . self-declared separatist mayor of slovyansk says militants hold 4 missing osce monitors .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- with time ticking by and an apparent dearth of clues , an eastern montana family clung thursday to hopes of finding a 43-year-old schoolteacher , last seen five days earlier out on a morning jog through her small town . an fbi official noted that investigators have received `` dozens and dozens '' of calls about sherry arnold , agency spokeswoman deborah bertram said thursday by e-mail . but the woman remains at large , and there are no named suspects in her disappearance . `` our thoughts are focused on her , we want her to return , we want to get her back , '' her husband , gary arnold , told hln 's jane velez-mitchell on thursday . `` that 's what keeps hope alive . '' sherry arnold went running around 6:30 a.m. saturday , but never returned home , the fbi said . other than one of her running shoes that was found along her route , authorities have not indicated there 's been any sign of arnold . this is despite an extensive search effort launched by authorities and aided by throngs of people around the area . sidney police chief frank difonzo said earlier this week that teams had been using dogs and aircraft and have gotten help from national guard members as well as volunteers . christine mullen , 26 , a cnn ireport contributor , said earlier this week that she went to the site of one of the searches , where thousands turned up to help . some set out on horses , others on atvs and more on foot covering `` a lot of pasture , dirt roads and farmland . '' arnold 's disappearance has hit the small community hard , including at sidney high school , where she is a math teacher . situated near north dakota and about 100 miles south of the canadian border , sidney has a population of just under 5,200 people , according to the u.s. census bureau . `` everybody is involved , '' said mullen , adding she does n't know arnold but still feels the impact . `` we 're such a small community , and crime is absolutely unheard of , '' mullen said . `` we do n't lock our car doors . -lrb- we 're -rrb- completely shocked . '' but this type of extensive effort was called off wednesday , when the fbi announced that `` law enforcement officials determined the prudent course of action is to scale back the ground search . '' the focus , instead , will shift toward `` other investigative efforts , '' though the fbi did not specify in its statement what those would be . `` i think the fbi is on top of it , as much as they can be , '' said gary arnold , adding that he believed his wife 's running route has been `` very , very thoroughly searched . '' `` they 're going to do the right thing and ask the right questions from the right people . we just need to get that one tip . '' on thursday , the fbi put out a poster of arnold and added her to its `` kidnapping and missing persons '' website . it noted that she was wearing running clothes , mittens , earbuds and a grayish-blue ipod at the time of her disappearance . `` we are hopeful this will generate more tips in the case , '' bertram said . `` our goal is to keep her information and picture out in the public . '' frigid temperatures have heightened concerns . the low temperature thursday night in sidney was expected to dip to 15 degrees fahrenheit , with daytime highs over the next two days forecast to be in the 30s , according to the national weather service . gary arnold said his wife 's disappearance has been `` very difficult '' on the couple 's children , though he said they are staying optimistic . `` their mother has raised them well , '' he said . `` they are troupers , they are hanging in there , and they are not giving up hope either . '':==:sherry arnold , 43 , went for a run on saturday and has n't been seen since . authorities found a lone shoe on her route but have n't disclosed anything else . the fbi says it has scaled back its search , even as it pleads for more information . arnold 's husband says he trusts the fbi , adding simply , `` we want her back '' .

santiago , chile -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- chile 's communist party said it wants authorities to exhume poet pablo neruda 's body as part of an investigation into his 1973 death . `` there is no other way to resolve this terrible doubt , '' lawyer eduardo contreras told chile 's radio bio-bio in an interview quoted in a statement on the party 's website . the nobel prize-winning poet 's death certificate says he died of prostate cancer , but neruda 's former chauffeur alleges that he was killed by an injection in the clinic where he was undergoing treatment , the communist party said . neruda died on september 23 , 1973 , just 12 days after a right-wing military coup that overthrew the south american country 's government . chilean judge mario carroza ordered an investigation into neruda 's death in june , noting that police , witness and medical records would be examined , chile 's judicial authority said . the judge has not said whether neruda 's body will be exhumed . a biography of the poet on the website of the neruda foundation , which neruda 's widow founded to promote and preserve his legacy , notes the coup as a significant date in his life . `` the majority of neruda 's friends were made prisoners or had to hide or seek political asylum in other countries , '' it says . but the foundation 's leader told radio bio-bio this week that the organization opposed the exhumation because they did not believe there was a `` third party '' involved in neruda 's death . `` we are against an exhumation of his cadaver because it would seem to us a true act of desecration , '' juan agustin figueroa said . neruda , a member of chile 's communist party , was also a lawmaker in the south american country and served as its ambassador to france . but internationally , he is most well known for his poetry . neruda received the nobel prize in literature 1971 `` for a poetry that with the action of an elemental force brings alive a continent 's destiny and dreams . '' as part of a massive investigation of 726 reported human rights violations during gen. augusto pinochet 's rule , authorities exhumed former chilean president salvador allende earlier this year . official accounts ruled the leftist leader 's death a suicide , saying that he shot himself -- with a gun that was reportedly a gift from fidel castro -- as pinochet 's troops closed in on the presidential palace . in july , chile 's legal medical service confirmed that suicide was the cause of allende 's death . cnn chile contributed to this report .:==:`` there is no other way to resolve this terrible doubt , '' a lawyer says . an investigation into the poet 's 1973 death began in june . neruda 's former chauffeur alleges that the poet was killed by an injection . his death certificate says he died of prostate cancer .

caracas , venezuela -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- standing in his food shack under posters of venezuelan president hugo chavez in a caracas slum , 70-year-old miguel bigello relays his backhanded support for barack obama . `` for all the deaths he 's caused , he 's not touched latin america , '' he said . `` the other guy -lsb- mitt romney -rsb- is too radical . he will fight here for the oil .

'' dallen adds that venezuela , or at least the chavez government , needs oil prices to stay high , and obama may be a safer bet for that . `` obama is more willing to tolerate high gasoline prices because gas at $ 4 a gallon makes people more willing to invest in alternative technologies and for those technologies to be more cost effective . '' postcard : obama , romney ignore afghans at own peril chavez is unlikely to be thinking in such depth . his support for obama recently marks the apex of the 58-year-old strongman 's relations with washington since coming to power in 1999 . the infamous nadir came in 2006 when chavez stood at the united nations lectern , theatrically sniffing the air . `` the devil came here yesterday , '' he said , a day after former president george w bush 's speech . `` it smells of sulfur still . '' he then went onto describe bush 's `` domination , exploitation , and pillage of the peoples of the world . '' chavez quipped two weeks ago that obama would support him too , had he been born in venezuela 's slums . after some shaky relations , chavez is prepared to start again . `` with the likely triumph of obama , and the extreme right defeated both here and there -lsb- in the u.s. -rsb- , i hope we can start a new period of normal relations . '':==:hugo chavez endorsed obama , calling him a ` good guy ' . venezuela-u.s. relations have been rocky for more than a decade . romney 's harder stance on chavez appeals to venezuelan opposition . america remains venezuela 's biggest oil market .
