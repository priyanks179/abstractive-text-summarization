islamabad , pakistan -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- in a letter to a pakistani schoolgirl shot in the head on her way home from school , a senior taliban commander purportedly tells her that she was targeted not because she advocated education for all girls , but rather for her criticism of the militant group . the letter attributed to adnan rashid was released just days after 16-year-old malala yousafzai took the stage at the united nations , where she delivered an emotional plea for the right to go to school on behalf of all children . malala was 15 when gunmen jumped on her school bus and shouted her name , scaring other girls into identifying her , in the swat valley on october 9 , 2012 . the attack sparked massive protests in pakistan and condemnation worldwide . `` the taliban believe you were intentionally writing against them and running a smear campaign to malign their effort to establish an islamic system in -lrb- the -rrb- swat valley , and your writings were provocative , '' according to the letter , which was dated monday and released to cnn by a pakistan intelligence source . `` you have said in your speech ... that the pen is mightier than the sword . so they attacked you for your sword not your books or school . '' malala at u.n. : the taliban failed to silence us cnn can not confirm the authenticity of the letter , but its validity has been generally accepted by pakistan intelligence officials . rashid made headlines last year after the taliban broke him out of a bannu prison , where he was serving a life sentence following his 2003 conviction for his role in the attempted murder of former president pervez musharraf . nearly 400 prisoners were freed in the jailbreak , which authorities believe was staged to get rashid out , a former pakistani air force officer . read more : the world 's other malalas in the letter , rashid said he was writing -- not as a taliban leader -- to say he was shocked by the shooting , and to express his regret that he did not warn malala ahead of time of the attack . the letter went on to say that the taliban supports the education of women , as long as it adheres to islamic law . he urged her , according to the letter , to return to pakistan and `` use your pen for islam and the plight of the muslim community . '' gordon brown , the u.n. special envoy on global education , blasted rashid 's letter . `` nobody will believe a word the taliban say about the right of girls like malala to go to school until they stop burning down schools and stop massacring pupils , '' he said in a statement released wednesday . gordon brown : malala 's u.n. speech is just the beginning this summer in pakistan , a teacher was gunned down in front of her son as she drove into her all-girl school . a school principal was killed and his students severely injured when a bomb was tossed onto a school playground at an all-girl school in karachi in march . in january , five teachers were killed near the town of swabi in the volatile northern khyber pakhtunkhwa province , the united nations says . and , in june , a suicide bomber blew up a bus carrying 40 schoolgirls as it made its way to an all-girl campus in quetta . fourteen female students were killed .:==:a letter purportedly from adnan rashid was made public this week . the letter blames malala yousafzai 's actions for the attack on her . in the letter , rashid says he was shocked by the attack . he urges her to return to pakistan .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- wednesday 's explosion on a bus carrying israeli tourists in bulgaria came on the 18th anniversary of the attack on a jewish community center in the argentinian capital of buenos aires , in which 85 people were killed . argentina 's top prosecutor last year blamed iran for the 1994 attack . israel also holds iran responsible for the attack . tehran has denied any connection to the buenos aires bombing , which it has condemned . such claims and counterclaims between israel and iran have been common in the past three decades , with each blaming the other for attacks on their citizens . israel , without citing evidence , quickly pointed to iran in the bulgarian incident . `` all signs point towards iran , '' israel prime minister benjamin netanyahu said . `` over the last few months we have seen iran 's attempts to attack israelis in thailand , india , georgia , kenya , cyprus and other countries . '' read netanyahu 's official statement at least seven people were killed in the bulgarian explosion . iran had no immediate reaction . after iranian nuclear scientists were assassinated in tehran , iran blamed israel . when attackers targeted israeli diplomats this year , israel blamed iran . iran hanged a man who was convicted of killing one of its nuclear scientists , state-run press tv reported in may . majid jamali fashi was convicted of the january 2010 killing of massoud ali mohammadi , an iranian university professor and a nuclear scientist . he was also convicted of spying . prosecutors accused him of working for the mossad , the israeli spy agency , and said he was paid $ 120,000 by israel to carry out the hit . israel typically does not comment on such claims . in january , iran sent a letter to the united nations secretary-general alleging the killings of the scientists were terrorist attacks that followed a clear pattern . `` there is firm evidence that certain foreign quarters are behind such assassinations , '' the letter said . in april , iran said it broke up an israeli `` terror and sabotage network '' that was planning attacks within the country , making a number of arrests while confiscating weapons and equipment , state-run media reported . `` the complicated and months-long measures and moves made by the iranian intelligence forces to identify the devils led to the discovery of the zionists ' regional command center ... and discovering the identity of the agents active in that command center , '' a statement from the iranian intelligence ministry said . previously on cnn.com : iranian supreme leader blames u.s. , israel for scientist 's death a spokesman for the israeli foreign ministry said then that every few months iran spreads disinformation and there was no basis to the story . ties between iran and israel unraveled after the 1979 islamic revolution in iran . after he was elected in 2005 , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad began spouting anti-israeli and anti-western rhetoric . yet it has been iran 's nuclear program that has raised the prospects of armed conflict . iran has been in a protracted dispute with the united states and other countries over its nuclear program , which it claims is for peaceful purposes . but many western countries fear the program is a cover for iran to develop nuclear weapons . just this week , u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton said iran has not made a `` strategic decision '' to address concerns . clinton : iran 's proposals are `` non-starters . '' israel , which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal and is alarmed over tehran 's hostility toward the jewish state , has said it may attack iran to try to stop the country from developing nuclear weapons . `` there is a world agreement that the iranian government is after nuclear weapons and that its policy of terrorism is endangering everybody . there is a global understating that we must do everything we can to prevent iran from endangering others , '' israeli president shimon peres said , according to the israeli foreign minister 's office . opinion : does u.s. matter in egypt and israel ? cnn 's joe sterling contributed to this report .:==:israel claims iran is behind explosion on bulgarian bus . it also has blamed tehran for attacks on diplomats . iran has pointed to israel in scientist deaths .

washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- calling state bans on same-sex marriage `` incompatible with the constitution , '' the obama administration friday filed a brief at the u.s. supreme court in support of couples who are making challenges in kentucky , michigan , ohio and tennessee . `` the marriage bans challenged in these cases impermissibly exclude lesbian and gay couples from the rights , responsibilities and status of civil marriage , '' solicitor general donald b. verrilli jr. wrote . he said the states have `` burdened petitioners in every aspect of life that marriage touches , from the mundane to the profound . '' the brief marks the first time the administration has formally made a filing with the high court supporting its position that bans on gay marriage should be declared unconstitutional nationwide . the court will hear arguments in the state cases on april 28 . verrilli said the laws `` impose concrete harms on same-sex couples and send the inescapable message that same-sex couples and their children are second-class families , unworthy of the recognition and benefits that opposite-sex couples take for granted . '' the bans , he said , `` can not be reconciled with the fundamental constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws . '' he said there is `` no adequate justification for such a discriminatory and injurious exercise of state control . '' verrilli stressed that throughout history lesbian and gay people have encountered numerous barriers that have `` prevented them from full , free , and equal participation in american life . '' in an op-ed earlier this week , published in usa today , attorney general eric holder wrote , `` marriage equality is an idea whose time has come . '' president barack obama 's position on same-sex marriage has evolved . in may 2012 , in an interview with abc news , he announced his support for gay marriage . `` at a certain point , '' he said , `` i 've just concluded that for me , personally , it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same-sex couples should be able to get married . '' at his 2013 inauguration he said , `` our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law . '' in february 2013 , the administration filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of couples challenging california 's ban on same sex marriage . verilli argued that california law provided same sex couples registered as domestic partners all the legal incidents of marriage , but denied them the `` designation of marriage . '' ultimately , the supreme court dismissed that case . supporters of the state bans have until the end of the month to file their briefs . thursday was the deadline for briefs in support of petitioners . james obergefell , the named plaintiff in the case , came to the court friday as the human rights campaign delivered a brief signed by over 200,000 individuals in support of same-sex marriage . in an interview , obergefell said his journey began when he challenged ohio 's refusal to recognize same-sex marriage on death certificates . he was legally married to his partner , john arthur james , in maryland in 2013 , but after arthur died , ohio officials refused to recognize obergefell as his spouse . asked what it would mean to him if his side wins , obergefell said , '' it will mean john and i matter . it will mean we have the same rights and responsibilities as other americans . '':==:administration files a brief before supreme court hears cases . brief says bans on same-sex marriage violate the constitution . those in favor or bans will file their arguments later this month .

washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the h1n1 flu virus could cause up to 90,000 u.s. deaths , mainly among children and young adults , if it resurges this fall as expected , according to a report released monday by a presidential advisory panel . the report urges speedier production of the h1n1 vaccine and the availability of some doses by september . the h1n1 virus , commonly known as swine flu virus , could infect between 30 percent and 50 percent of the american population during the fall and winter and lead to as many as 1.8 million u.s. hospital admissions , the president 's council of advisors on science and technology reported . the report says 30,000 to 90,000 deaths are projected as part of a `` plausible scenario '' involving large outbreaks at schools , inadequate antiviral supplies and the virus peaking before vaccinations have time to be effective . up to 40,000 u.s. deaths are linked to seasonal flu each year , with most of the fatalities occurring among people over 65 . with seasonal flu and h1n1 , this fall is expected to bring more influenza deaths and place `` enormous stress '' on intensive care units nationwide , which normally operate near capacity , the report says . an h1n1 resurgence may happen as early as september , at the beginning of the school year , and infections may peak in mid-october , according to the report . however , the h1n1 vaccine is n't expected to be available until mid-october , and even then it will take several weeks for vaccinated individuals to develop immunity , the report says . watch more on h1n1 predictions for this fall '' the potential `` mismatch in timing '' could significantly diminish the usefulness of the h1n1 vaccine , the report says . `` even with the best efforts , this will cause some illness , some severe illness and unfortunately , some deaths , '' thomas frieden , director of the centers for disease control and prevention , said monday . `` but a lot so far has gone remarkably right , '' frieden said . `` there 's a vaccine well on its way to being distributed , diagnostic tests available in well over 100 laboratories , treatments pre-positioned around the country ... and guidance issued for health care providers , schools , businesses and other communities . '' among the report 's recommendations are for government agencies to : • prepare several `` planning scenarios '' to determine demand for supplies and care . • set up surveillance systems to track information about influenza-like illnesses . • develop plans to protect the public 's most vulnerable groups , such as pregnant women and those with pre-existing medical conditions . • speed up the production of the h1n1 vaccine and have an initial batch -- enough to vaccinate up to 40 million people , especially those who are at risk of serious disease -- by mid-september . health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius said the government 's preparation and guidance for the public was based on the need to strike a balance `` on a continuum of being paralyzed with fear versus complacency . '' so far , clinical trials for the h1n1 vaccine have not indicated adverse side effects beyond what are experienced with the seasonal flu vaccine , sebelius said . however , there would be no formal decision to launch a vaccination campaign until those trials were complete , she said . that decision would be hers , she said , and she emphasized that any vaccination program would be strictly voluntary . pregnant women , health care workers and parents or guardians of infants under 6 months of age are among the most vulnerable segments of the population , sebelius has said . adults under the age of 65 with an underlying health condition -- such as asthma -- are also considered to be more at risk from the h1n1 virus . h1n1 preparation guidelines for the nation 's businesses and school systems were released three weeks ago . the plans are available at the web site www.flu.gov . the h1n1 vaccine would require two shots , the second three weeks after the first . immunity to the virus would not kick in until two weeks after the second shot . the world health organization declared the h1n1 virus a global pandemic on june 11 . more than 1,490 people around the world have died from the virus since it emerged this spring , a who official said last week . cnn 's caleb hellerman contributed to this report .:==:panel : up to 50 percent of u.s. population could be infected this fall , winter . h1n1 , plus seasonal flu , could place `` enormous stress '' on hospitals . vaccine expected in mid-october , but too late to help many , panel says . panel urges availability of some doses by mid-september .

hong kong -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the real crisis confronting the eurozone is regaining market confidence , not the euro , german foreign minister guido westerwelle said friday . `` some people wonder if we 're overcoming the euro crisis the right way , '' said westerwelle , speaking at the asia society in hong kong . `` we do not have a euro crisis , we have a debt crisis which has morphed into a crisis of confidence . the euro is stable and is the number two reserve currency in the world . '' to bolster market confidence in the eurozone , westerwelle -- who is part of the cabinet-level entourage traveling with german chancellor angela merkel for her two-day summit in china -- said it was essential that greece and other debt-laden economies in europe maintain paths toward reform . athens and berlin in spat over funds greek cuts to be deeper than trailed last week , greek prime minister antonis samaras met with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin to ask for more `` breathing space '' for greece to implement austerity reforms . the troika -- consisting of the european union , the european central bank and the international monetary fund -- is due to report on greece 's progress next month . `` i do n't want to be part of this greece bashing , because it 's a real challenge for them . i feel for the people on the streets of greece , because the people were n't responsible for what their leaders missed in the past decade . `` we feel solidarity but we have to insist they fulfill what they promised , '' westerwelle continued . `` we ca n't allow them to weaken the reform agenda . it would have a very negative effect in trying to restore confidence to greece and the european union . '' he also questioned how the spanish government could be persuaded to stay on path if any agreement with greece was weakened . catalonia heightens spanish debt fears westerwelle pointed to germany 's own debt woes in the wake of west germany 's reunification with east germany during the 1990s . `` it was only 10 years ago that germany was the sick man of europe . reforms may be painful , but they will pay off and that 's what we germans have experienced first hand , '' he said . even as he advocates strict adherence to austerity measures , westerwelle has been a strong voice against politicians who suggest greece should soon exit the eurozone . `` the bullying against individual euro countries to achieve political gains must stop , '' westerwelle said after alexander dobrindt , the executive secretary of the christian social union of bavaria , suggested a greek departure was imminent , the german daily rheinische post reported on monday . earlier this month , westerwelle warned on the `` dangerous tone '' arguments on european union were taking . `` we must take care not to talk europe down , '' he said in a statement , released after italian prime minister mario monti told a german paper that eurozone tensions `` bear the traits of a psychological dissolution of europe . '' as developing economies like china and india create more regional centers of financial power , a strong eu is `` life insurance '' for germany 's future , especially as the eurozone represents only about 9 % of the world population , westerwelle continued . `` europe and european unity is not only our destiny , but our desire , '' he said . `` there can be no good future for germany without a good future for a united europe , '' westerwelle said . read more : merkel faces eu clash over china:==:westerwelle : the euro is stable , but the ` real crisis is regaining market confidence ' . german foreign minister in hong kong as part of germany 's two-day summit in china . westerwelle said it was essential that greece and others to maintain paths toward reform . `` there can be no good future for germany without a good future for a united europe '' .
