-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- finally . that 's all that needs to be said about president barack obama 's decision this week to stop playing footsie with gop senators and push through the recess appointments for the head of the consumer financial protection bureau and members of the national labor relations board . republican are in a tizzy , saying he is establishing a bad precedent with the moves . but frankly , they need to shut up . it has been their shameful and callous actions in holding up countless presidential nominees that has led us to this precarious moment in political history . but let 's not act like the democratic senators are standing on firm moral ground . they were also obstructionists during the final few years of president george w. bush 's second term , and they played the same game of hideaway as the republicans are doing now , even though the gop has taken stalling to extraordinary heights . as for president obama , he has played nice for far too long , unwilling to load up the administration with his nominees through the constitutionally protected avenue of recess appointments . it 's hilarious to listen to strict constructionist conservatives talk about the u.s. constitution as a hallowed document , only to hear their chagrin when someone actually follows it . every president has the right to make recess appointments , and if you hear the gop critics , you would swear presidents george h.w. bush and george w. bush did n't use the power of recess appointments to fill vacancies . but they did , specifically with the national labor relations board , the same group that now has three open slots that the gop has been blocking president obama from filling . this is a silly , partisan game that i ca n't stand . every president should be able to appoint a team to his liking . yes , the u.s. constitution says the u.s. senate gets to `` advise and consent , '' but it says nothing about holding up appointments in perpetuity . it 's shameful when a president makes an appointment and that person goes six months to nearly two years before they get a hearing or an up-and-down vote . the u.s. senate should be able and willing to move a lot faster when filling vacancies , but the partisan divide keeps that from happening . with president obama in office , the gop does n't want to see what they describe as liberal judges appointed to the federal bench . and when there is a republican in the white house , democrats voice their anger at conservative judges being appointed . folks , that 's what happens in elections . there are consequences to winning and losing . president obama 's willingness to take on the congress directly is a welcome departure from the reach-out-and-touch someone philosophy he operated by the last three years . look , i get bipartisanship -- we should have folks from both parties acting like grownups and getting along -- but if you look at the overwhelming number of obama appointees being held up , it 's clear that this system is broken . weakness is nothing to be happy about . and too often , president obama has operated more on the weak and meek side when dealing with congress rather than as a strong leader with conviction . this decision , coupled with the far more aggressive tone he has taken with his critics , has led to an increase in his poll numbers , and is the kind of fire in the belly his supporters are happy to see . the fear is that the president will fall back into the mode of walking softly with a big stick . sorry , when folks are misbehaving , you have to whack them upside the head with that big stick in order for them to get the message . the gop can crow all day about these appointments . they are likely to lose if they challenge the president in court . maybe their continuing intransigence will keep president obama operating with a short fuse , ready to explode on the opposition when warranted . now that 's a change in attitude we can believe in . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of roland s. martin .:==:president obama filled several key posts through recess appointments . roland martin says he had to act because republicans were stalling his nominees . he says democrats also were wrong in obstructing appointments by george w. bush . martin says obama 's new tough approach is long overdue .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- chevron filed an appeal with ecuador 's national court to review a ruling that it must pay billions of dollars in damages for oil pollution in the amazon rain forest . in addition to the $ 8.6 billion ruling , the court said that chevron must publicly apologize to ecuador , and if it fails to do so , the fine will be doubled to nearly $ 18 billion . the ruling chevron is appealing was handed by an ecuadorian appeals court on january 4 , nearly a year after the panel received the case , the state-run andes news agency reported . the case stems from claims that the company had a detrimental impact on amazonian communities where it operated . chevron says it has filed the appeal with ecuador 's national court of justice . `` throughout the course of this litigation , judges corruptly operating in concert with the plaintiffs ' lawyers have created , rather than corrected , injustice , '' hewitt pate , chevron vice president and general counsel , said friday . chevron 's appeal is the latest in 19 years of litigation between amazon residents and texaco , which was later purchased by chevron . at the time of the january ruling , chevron said the appeals court decision `` is another glaring example of the politicization and corruption of ecuador 's judiciary that has plagued this fraudulent case from the start . '' the company alleges that reports and evidence against it were fraudulent , and that bribes and corruption led to the original decision against it . `` chevron does not believe that the ecuador ruling is enforceable in any court that observes the rule of law . the company will continue to seek to hold accountable the perpetrators of this fraud , '' the company said in a statement . when an ecuadorian court handed down the original ruling last year , both chevron and the amazonian residents appealed . chevron argued the verdict was the product of fraud and the plaintiffs said the size of the award was too small in comparison to what would be needed to do a real clean-up . the case , aguinda v. chevrontexaco , was originally filed in new york in 1993 on behalf of 30,000 inhabitants of ecuador 's amazon region . the suit was eventually transferred to the ecuadorian court and ecuadorian jurisdiction . the lawsuit alleges that texaco used a variety of substandard production practices in ecuador that resulted in pollution that decimated several indigenous groups in the area , according to a fact sheet provided by the amazon defense coalition . according to the group , texaco dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into amazon waterways , abandoned more than 900 waste pits , burned millions of cubic meters of gases with no controls and spilled more than 17 million gallons of oil due to pipeline ruptures . cancer and other health problems were reported at higher rates in the area , the group says . chevron says texaco was partnered with an ecuadorian oil company when it operated in ecuador , and that it spent $ 40 million on remediation efforts to clean up roughly one-third of the sites in which it worked -- an amount reflective of its 37 % share of the oil-producing consortium with petroecuador . it says its cleanup efforts were certified and approved by the ecuardorian government and blames petroecuador for any ongoing pollution at sites where it was the sole operator , according to documents on the chevron website regarding the lawsuit and its history of operations in the south american country .:==:chevron 's appeal continues 19 years of litigation . the fine will double if chevron does not apologize , an appeals court has ruled . the company says the case is fraudulent . it does not believe the ruling is enforceable .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- on sunday , there was a rally in london to protest something i never thought would need protesting in modern britain : the rise of anti-semitism . the rally was in reaction to a series of strange , unsettling incidents that took place during the recent demonstrations against israeli military actions in gaza . in one case , the manager of a supermarket in london decided to take all the kosher food off the shelves . he apparently feared that demonstrators outside might trash the shop ; one member of the staff reportedly said , `` we support free gaza . '' the supermarket chain called it `` an isolated decision ... in a very challenging situation . '' isolated it may have been , but it is part of a bigger picture . there have always been people in the west who disagree with aspects of israeli foreign policy and there has always been a peace movement ready to protest israel 's actions . but what has made the 2014 protests different is the growing conflation of israel in particular with jews in general . not all kosher food comes from israel , not all jews who eat it agree with the assault on gaza . yet such an important distinction between state and racial identity has begun to erode . the result : a return of low-level anti-semitism to public life . of course , some of it has never gone away . just two years after the end of the second world war , there were anti-semitic riots across britain . europe has an insidious history of holocaust denial , and even a multicultural haven like new york has seen racial tensions flare . but in 2014 , anti-semitism went global all at once . in july , an anti-israeli demonstration in paris broke into racist rioting : jewish-owned shops and synagogues were targeted . in berlin , they were chanting : `` jew , jew , cowardly pig , come out and fight alone . '' in new york , just last week , a jewish couple were roughed up by thugs waving palestinian flags , according to the new york post . in my native britain , anti-semitic attacks have risen and we 've seen the return of old prejudices on anti-war marches . it 's important to stress that these are -- like the kosher food disappearance -- `` isolated '' incidents that do not indict everyone in the peace movement . but they are making jewish communities which once felt safe suddenly feel threatened . emigration to israel by french jews jumped 70 % in 2013 and will likely be even higher this year . at the beginning of the gaza operation , times columnist hugo rifkind wrote in the spectator that he was uncomfortable with israel 's policies . one month later , after the protests , he wrote in the times that he felt `` uncomfortable to be a jew . '' there is a creeping sense of sickness in all of this . like a virus that starts with an itch in the back of your throat -- that you suspect could be something dormant about to break through . part of the reason is genuine , understandable anger at what has happened in gaza . but while that might explain fury at the israeli state , it does not explain attacks on jews overseas . after all , a state does not speak for all its citizens , let alone its ethnic diaspora . in die welt newspaper , one jewish german wrote , `` jewish students get anti-zionist hate mail when israel responds to rocket attacks by hamas . the loudest part of supporters of palestine has lost all sense and gives all the guilt to anyone who wears a skullcap or a star of david . '' he added : `` for jews , the danger comes not long only from the right . '' that is a big part of the problem . anti-semitism has historically been associated with the far right , parties of which have capitalized upon the credit crunch and done well in recent european elections . the recession has drawn some back into narrow-minded nationalism , and even the blood and soil politics of the 1930s . the most striking examples of this are the virulently racist jobbik movement in hungary or the more subtly racist front national in france . but anti-semitism has also been allowed , even invited , to enter the left , too . the peace movement has been reinvigorated by muslim immigration to europe , and aspects of the left have made alliances with people who make spurious claims to be muslim community leaders . in reality , those leaders do not speak for the vast , vast majority of muslims who understand the distinction between israeli policy and jews . but the influence of this particular brand of islamic extremism is being felt on the marches -- as the parisian riots attest . at the same time , left-wing critics of western foreign policy have often flirted with the notion that there is an unholy alliance of america and israel making all the decisions . or even that israel is in fact directing what the united states does through a conspiracy of lobbyists , capital and media . i encountered this firsthand when i did a tv debate with a leader of the stop the war coalition in london last week . i was told that the west was only supporting the kurds against isis in northern iraq because of american and israeli oil interests . i laughed . i could think of no more fitting response . that experience caps several years of noticing a quiet perversion of peace movement politics taking place . on a personal note , i am anti-interventionist -lrb- borderline pacifist -rrb- and happily marched with the stop the war coalition against the iraq war in 2003 . but when working as a lecturer a few years later , i quit my labor union when it signed on to a boycott of israeli academics . and i 've witnessed a strange slide within the anti-war movement toward a variety of politics that leaves a bitter taste in the mouth . obviously , i 'm concerned about a rise of a socially acceptable anti-semitism that threatens the well-being of those jewish friends that i know and love . but i also despair that the european peace movement has allowed this situation to develop without stopping even to think about it . the tolerance that some on the left are showing toward anti-semitism threatens to delegitimize fair and reasonable criticism of israeli policy . they have allowed a potentially noble cause to be infiltrated by people without a shred of nobility . they need to put their house in order before it collapses down on all of us .:==:tim stanley : anti-semitism surfaced in the wake of the controversy over gaza war . he says some conflate israel and its policies with jews in general . it 's vital to ensure that historic prejudice does n't get revived , he says . stanley : anti-semitism has long been connected to far right , but some on left tolerate it .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- plenty of french comedies have been adapted for the american audience -lrb- `` three men and a baby , '' `` dinner for schmucks '' and `` the birdcage '' among others -rrb- . but french-canadian comedies ? not so much . `` starbuck '' is the rare quã © bã © cois film that will get the hollywood treatment . the story of a prolific sperm donor who learns he has fathered more than 500 children will open next fall under the title `` delivery man , '' with vince vaughn in the starring role . but months before `` delivery man '' comes out , american moviegoers are getting a chance to see the french-language original . `` starbuck '' is about to expand to theaters in dallas , houston and other cities after opening in new york , los angeles and boston . it 's earned positive reviews from many american critics including the washington post 's michael o'sullivan , who called the film a crowd-pleaser with `` charm to burn . '' the post and the new york times praised actor patrick huard 's performance as david wozniak -lrb- the vaughn role -rrb- , an affable underachiever who only learns of his prodigious reproductive record after 142 of his offspring file a class action suit seeking to reveal the identity of the donor known only as starbuck . `` we felt that it was a great premise to explore what fatherhood is all about today , '' says director and co-writer ken scott . in a conversation with cnn in los angeles , scott and his star described `` starbuck '' as the rare comedy that translates across cultures . `` we 've had a great success in quebec and now the film is traveling throughout the world , '' scott said . `` comedies do n't always travel as well as other genres , so it 's a pleasant surprise . '' huard attributes the film 's widespread appeal to its earnest tone . `` when you have the tagline , ` this guy is the father of 533 kids , ' you 're expecting a kind of , maybe almost goofy comedy . and that 's not the case -lrb- with this film -rrb- , '' he told cnn . `` the movie -lrb- is -rrb- actually touching and more human than just being funny . i think people responded very well to that ... and i think that 's why it talks to people outside of montreal and quebec -- it 's just universal themes . '' that universal quality apparently was n't lost on the people at dreamworks , who snapped up the english-language rights . scott adapted his original script -lrb- co-written with martin petit -rrb- . in another coup , dreamworks also tapped him to direct the remake . `` we felt that there was that potential to have a movie made here with the american culture -- with this story but with the american culture embedded into it , '' scott said . scott would n't reveal what changes he made for hollywood other than the title -lrb- the studio perhaps thinking `` starbuck '' would suggest a film about coffee -rrb- . but given how middle-of-the-road many american comedies can be , it seems unlikely `` delivery man '' will begin , as `` starbuck '' does , with a masturbation scene . the constant between both films is the main character 's journey -- from carefree lug to a guy with greater maturity who tries to play a positive role in the lives of his many , many children . scott expresses surprise at how quickly the hollywood version came together , right down to casting the leading man . `` we hooked up right away with vince vaughn and he was great . he loved the story , loved the original , and he had a window of availability for us in september -lrb- 2012 -rrb- , so it all just happened very smoothly , '' scott said . huard praises his american counterpart . `` i 've seen a lot of vince vaughn 's comedies , like ` made ' and ` swingers . ' the guy is great . i think it 's going to be a great part for him . '' huard denies feeling proprietary about the role he originated . `` a part is a part , '' he told cnn . `` it 's like music . i happen to be the luckiest guy because i was the first to play that symphony , but there 'll be a remake also in france and one in india in a bollywood kind of way , and i think i 'm just privileged to be the first to do it . but it 's such a great part i 'm very happy that it 's going to be played again but in a different way . '' `` delivery man '' is due for release in october . scott said if this new version meets with success , it will be icing on the cake . `` our greatest expectations have been exceeded a long time ago . '':==:french-language `` starbuck '' undergoes a hollywood remake . american version will be called `` delivery man '' and star vince vaughn . the film is about a sperm-donor who has fathered hundreds of children .

united nations -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the united nations ' secretary-general called once again wednesday for a cessation of violence in syria and for international action . `` in syria , more than 5,000 people are dead . this can not go on , '' ban ki-moon told reporters during his annual year-end news conference . `` in the name of humanity , it is time for the international community to act . '' ban told reporters he had given to the u.n. security council a report released by the human rights council earlier this month detailing widespread abuses by the syrian government . u.n. action on syria has remained deadlocked in the security council , where china and russia , among others , remain skeptical about the need for them to become involved . in october , the two countries issued a rare double veto of a toothless resolution condemning the violence in syria . refugees seek shelter in lebanon the u.s. state department singled out russia on tuesday for holding up action against syria . `` we think it is past time for the u.n. security council to speak up , '' state department spokeswomen victoria nuland said . at issue is the so-called `` responsibility to protect '' -- the idea that the international community has an obligation to shield civilians from violence by their own government . it was an idea invoked for the first time by the security council in the march resolution that authorized military intervention in libya . some members of the security council , including china and russia , have since expressed concern that nato overstepped the mandate of the libya resolution . the secretary-general strongly rejected that proposition wednesday , saying the resolution was `` strictly enforced . '' `` these changes of regime were done by the people , not by the intervention of any foreign forces or the united nations , '' ban said of the arab spring . he said he was `` encouraged '' by the security council 's use of the responsibility to protect principle . `` we played an essential role in the liberation of libya , '' he said . `` we stand ready to continue to help tunisia and egypt at their request . '' ban rejected criticism that he had not paid enough attention to the negative implications of the arab spring for women and minorities . pressure grows for intervention `` from beginning of this arab spring , whenever i had an opportunity of speaking or meeting with arab leaders , i made it quite pointedly this role of women , '' he said . `` it 's not just lip service . '' ban also drew parallels between the arab spring and the occupy wall street movement . industrialization and globalization has created a global `` gap '' between rich and poor , especially among women and youths , he said . `` i have thought , with my senior advisers , very seriously how united nations can be relevant , and can be helpful , in addressing these issues , '' he said .:==:`` it is time for the international community to act '' in syria , ban ki-moon says . the united nations played `` essential role in libya , '' he says . ban draws a parallel between occupy wall street and arab spring .
