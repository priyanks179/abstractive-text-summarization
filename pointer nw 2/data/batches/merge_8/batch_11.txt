-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- jon voight had screwed up . in the early '60s , when he was a struggling actor , he 'd had a big , emotional scene in the tv drama `` naked city . '' by his own account , he fell short . he wanted to apologize to the casting director who 'd helped him get the role , marion dougherty . he drafted letters . he imagined talking to her . he was embarrassed by the performance . `` i was so bad , i got almost physically sick watching it , '' he recalls in a new documentary , `` casting by . '' several years later , he desperately wanted the lead role in a new john schlesinger film , `` midnight cowboy . '' but the casting director for `` midnight cowboy '' was marion dougherty . voight flew to new york to meet with her . he showed up at her door and abjectly apologized . but dougherty , always openhearted , was having none of it . `` jon , that 's the past , '' he remembered her saying . `` how would you like to meet john schlesinger ? '' voight was nominated for an oscar for the film , which was named 1969 's best picture , and he was on his way . that 's just one of many stories about the gracious and shrewd dougherty , a casting pioneer , shared in `` casting by . '' the documentary about casting directors , which celebrates the contributions of this most neglected of hollywood occupations , is scheduled to air on hbo monday night . dougherty , whose five-decade career started in tv 's early days , gets particular attention . she is credited with revolutionizing the movie business by hiring many of the talents she saw in the new york acting world -- people such as voight , al pacino , glenn close , robert de niro , dustin hoffman , diane lane , john travolta and robert redford . her rise fortuitously coincided with the decline of the studio system , which swept away the contract players who were slotted into movies like so many items from a chinese menu . she was also a mentor to a number of future casting directors , including juliet taylor -lrb- who has done more than three dozen films with woody allen , as well as `` schindler 's list , '' `` working girl '' and `` network '' -rrb- and ellen lewis -lrb- `` forrest gump , '' `` the birdcage '' and several martin scorsese pictures -rrb- . '' -lrb- doing the movie -rrb- opened a window for me into this world of casting that i 'd never really been conscious of before , '' says `` casting by '' director tom donahue in a phone interview . `` i did n't really understand the contributions of the casting director and how important they are creatively . '' ` everybody thinks they know how to cast ' he is n't the only one . though casting can make or break a movie , the job is often overlooked -- certainly by moviegoers , who may not be aware of the long process it takes to find the right actors for the right roles , and even by the movie business itself . indeed , the casting director 's film credit is `` casting by '' because the directors guild of america long prevented anyone else from being called a `` director '' on a movie . -lrb- the rule has been relaxed for cinematographers , often called `` directors of photography , '' and art directors . -rrb- `` it 's not something that most people understand , '' says marcia ross , a veteran casting director whose credits include `` oblivion , '' `` the princess diaries '' and `` clueless . '' -lrb- one of her former assistants , kate lacey , was a producer on `` casting by . '' -rrb- `` there 's a tendency in casting , because people know who actors are , that almost everybody thinks they know how to cast . '' casting , she says , means going through countless reels , submissions and auditions in search of filling movie roles ; getting to know actors ' representatives and schedules ; establishing a rapport with the director ; and , these days more than ever , being able to negotiate a hollywood system in which many people have a stake in a movie 's financial , as well as artistic , success . `` there 's a lot of micromanagement and a lot of committee involvement , '' says ross . `` it 's harder than ever to get actors cast . '' it 's a conundrum : producers may want an established name , while casting directors may see an unknown with real potential -- an unknown who wo n't get a chance until he becomes , well , an established name . and yet , she says , the job has real rewards -- particularly when those unknowns break through . it was a thrill dougherty knew over and over , with her string of new york-trained performers . -lrb- her secret ? `` gut reaction , '' she says in the film . -rrb- ross , too , has given some actors their breakout roles , including paul rudd -lrb- `` clueless '' -rrb- and chris pine -lrb- `` the princess diaries 2 '' -rrb- . when `` diaries 2 '' came along , pine -- now known as `` star trek 's '' capt. james t. kirk -- was ready to go back to new york after hacking around hollywood for the occasional tv guest spot , says ross . `` i was very taken with him , and i brought him in for -lrb- director -rrb- garry marshall and he was terrific , '' she recalls . `` but the thing with chris was he 'd never done a movie and nobody knew him . i think people were a little nervous . but i really believed in him , and i made a really good case for him , and he got the part . '' ` inside , benjamin braddock is short and jewish ' casting is often inspired , a wonderful bit of serendipity . `` there 's something magic in finding the right person for a part , '' says ross . there are any number of examples . redford was supposed to play butch cassidy in `` butch cassidy and the sundance kid , '' but thought he was more appropriate for sundance -- and dougherty backed him up . `` casting by 's '' donahue says clint eastwood was actually considered for the lead in 1978 's `` superman , '' but lynn stalmaster -- another casting pioneer -- believed the role would be better served with an unknown , and went to bat for christopher reeve . and , in a classic bit of casting , dustin hoffman got the role of benjamin braddock in `` the graduate . '' in charles webb 's novel , braddock is an athletic , upper-class wasp -- someone who looks like redford , who was actually considered for the role -- but stalmaster and director mike nichols were looking for someone who could project the character 's insecurity . in a `` casting by '' clip , hoffman remembers his uncertainty . `` i said to nichols , i did not think i was right for the role . -lrb- braddock is -rrb- kind of anglo-saxon , tall , slender , good-looking , '' hoffman recalled . `` and he said , ` you 're jewish . ' i said , ` that 's right -- short and jewish . ' he said , ` well , inside , benjamin braddock is short and jewish . ' '' despite their key role in shaping movies , casting directors still do n't get all the credit they deserve . that was literal in the beginning : stalmaster was the first casting director to get `` single-card credit '' -lrb- in which the person is the only credit listed on the screen -rrb- , for 1968 's `` the thomas crown affair . '' even today , there 's still some resistance . despite attempts to get the position recognized for oscar consideration , the motion picture academy has yet to do so . -lrb- moreover , when colleagues pushed dougherty for honorary oscar recognition , that attempt , too , failed . -rrb- nevertheless , the actors have remembered . one of the pleasures of `` casting by '' is watching performers who have long since gone on to fame and fortune become their younger selves -- telling stories about being hard-up for rent , scrapping for food , wondering about their next job , and then being blessed by a casting director 's wand . ross , who 's been in casting for more than 30 years , says the idea of making and breaking careers does n't enter her mind , however . she simply believes in what she does . `` i love talent , '' she says . `` the business has changed so much , but at the very core of it , my love of talent and helping them get the opportunity to work has not changed . '' dougherty , who died in 2011 , felt the same way -- and the feeling was reciprocal : `` casting by '' ends with a chorus of tributes from colleagues . she may not have been well-known , but voight pays her a great compliment -- one due to so many casting directors . `` she could see what people could n't see , '' he says .:==:`` casting by '' celebrates casting directors , especially pioneer marion dougherty . dougherty reshaped business by casting new york actors . casting director 's role often overlooked , but it 's key in shaping film .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- there 's been a lot of talk lately suggesting that the era of taking your shoes off when you pass through airport security may be coming to an end . that sounds great , but i would n't get too excited just yet . this may be a ray of hope for those looking for a less burdensome air travel security experience , but it 's really just a tiny piece of what needs to be fixed with security . if it happens , it will only have a very slight impact on the overall experience . the buzz was started by secretary janet napolitano of the department of homeland security . at an event recently , she said that when it comes to air travel screening , `` one of the first things you will see over time is the ability to keep your shoes on . '' so , will this be happening soon ? i doubt it . note the part that says `` over time . '' you 'll remember that the rule requiring people to take their shoes off when they pass through security came after richard reid put explosives in his shoes and tried to light them in flight . he was n't successful at blowing up an airplane , but he was successful at making security screening more miserable . traditional metal detectors could n't catch the explosives , so people were forced to put their shoes on the x-ray belt like everything else . homeland security gets mixed reviews ahead of 9/11 anniversary why is napolitano now suggesting that this rule will end ? the government has yet to find a technology it considers adequate for scanning shoes while they 're still on people 's feet . until that happens , i simply ca n't imagine any change happening . maybe this means that a new technology is on the horizon , but we 've seen that song and dance before . -lrb- remember the puffer machines ? -rrb- this sounds like a lot of talk with no real timeline in sight other than some vague promises down the line . even if it does happen , will it improve the screening experience enough ? in the same breath , napolitano also said , `` one of the last things you will probably see is a reduction or removing the limitation on liquids . '' sigh . so you might be able to keep your shoes on , but you 'll still have to pull your laptop out of your bag , limit yourself to a quart-size bag filled with 3-ounce liquids and subject yourself to a variety of screening techniques that use multiple types of machines with seemingly arbitrary rules at every airport . pistole : airport security is safer , but no guarantee some believe that making security more pleasant will help spur more people to travel . that might be the case if the process speeds up enough to make it worth considering air travel for shorter flights that may not be as competitive with the car today . but just allowing someone to keep his shoes on wo n't make much of a difference . until there is widespread belief that there is a convenient , non-intrusive security method that keeps our skies safe , then the number of people willing to travel wo n't change . something tells me we are n't going to see any big changes like this for years and years .:==:homeland security secretary : shoe rule may change `` over time '' . government has yet to find an adequate way for scanning shoes . snyder : we probably wo n't see any big changes for years .

new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- this classic chant of `` extra ! extra ! read all about it ! '' -- barked out by battalions of newsboys hawking newspapers -- died decades ago , a casualty of home delivery , mass distribution and the advent of coin-operated newspaper machines . some coin-operated newspaper machines have lasted for 30 years , but lack of sales may force their retirement . but now as newspapers across the country wage a battle to survive in a market where readers are increasingly gravitating to the internet for information , the fate of another industry fixture seems inevitable . could those steel machines on street corners , distributing newspapers since the '50s , be headed for the scrap pile ? to begin to answer the question , all it takes is an early morning visit with a man who feeds those machines . it 's 5:30 a.m. on a saturday , and a white delivery truck for the new jersey record has just pulled into the parking lot outside the plaza diner in fort lee , new jersey . the driver -- mike , who asked that his last name not be used -- is at one of his 130 stops on an eight-hour shift that began at midnight . mike 's job , which takes less than a couple of minutes per stop , entails filling the coin-operated machine with the day 's papers , collecting unsold copies and emptying the machine of its coins . even though mike has a full schedule and lots of stops , it does n't equate to pushing as many papers as he once did . mike loads 15 copies of the record into one machine -- and that 's a good load , he says . other locations receive only five to seven copies . he 's also tasked with filling machines for usa today . though he 's been on this job for only two years , mike has been on the route long enough to know business is down . he says newspapers sell better at train stations than from the street machines he services . the demise of newspapers across the country is getting a lot of front-page headlines . the seattle post-intelligencer in washington was just one of the most recent victims , ceasing print publication in march as declining circulation and plummeting advertising sales forced it to retrench and become just an online provider of journalism . even the legendary new york times will force readers to dig deeper for more coins as it raises prices june 1 , with the price of a paper going from $ 1.50 to $ 2 . the publication that touts `` all the news that 's fit to print '' has been relying less on newspaper racks . in 1999 , the times had 13,300 vending machines , but today that number has shrunk to 5,678 , according to diane mcnulty , spokeswoman for the times . `` one of the factors is home delivery , '' mcnulty said , adding , `` this was due to our national expansion -- where once many readers could only get copies from the newsstand or vending machine , they can now enjoy home delivery service . '' but all the gloom-and-doom predictions that newspapers will one day disappear is n't scaring workers at the kaspar sho-rack company , based in shiner , texas . the company lays claim to being the world 's largest manufacturer of coin-operated and no-charge newspaper vending machines . don kaspar is president and a fourth-generation member of a family business that began in 1898 manufacturing wire products . `` there 'll be printed newspapers for years and years '' said kaspar , president of a company that is actually part of the larger kaspar wireworks . still , he concedes , `` business is down about 25 to 30 percent from about five years ago . '' it was n't until the late 1950s that the privately owned company was approached by the now defunct san antonio light newspaper to develop an early version of coin-operated newspaper machines . the early versions of newspaper machines were simple and made mostly of wire , but by the mid-1960s they were all made of metal . the machines typically consist of a thick metal housing , shelves , doors and hinges . but the heart of any machine is the coin mechanism , which can have 150 moving parts , according to the manufacturer . some advanced models introduced in 1999 feature lithium batteries to run the coin-collecting mechanism . often weighing around 100 pounds , these hand-assembled machines cost on average $ 450 each , with refurbished models selling for around $ 300 , the company says . the zenith of the company 's business may have been the 1980s , when the introduction of usa today landed it a contract to build and deliver 100,000 coin-operated machines . today only 65,000 machines populate the nation 's sidewalks , according to a usa today spokesperson . in 1985 , sho-rack sold its 1 millionth newspaper machine and it has sold several hundred thousand since . its biggest clients have been the giants of newspaper publishing , including gannett , tribune , newhouse and the mcclatchy newspaper groups . but the fate of those publishers directly affects the bottom line at sho-rack . `` business now ? it 's certainly slowed down , '' said kaspar . `` free publication racks ... we 've stayed fairly busy with those . coin - operated machines ? newspapers are cutting costs and pulling a lot of the racks from outlying areas . as a result this causes a surplus number of racks and then ultimately less of a need for new racks from us . '' though the coin-operated machine business makes up 25 percent of the parent company 's overall business , sho-rack has learned to diversify and adapt . `` we 're not dependent on any one industry , '' kaspar said . the company , which employs nearly 500 workers and occupies more than 500,000 square feet in a small rural town , also manufactures thousands of wire , tubing and sheet metal products . the average life span of a coin-operated newspaper machine depends on several factors . some machines , even with modest refurbishments every couple of years , have lasted for 30 years . for others it can be five minutes after an encounter with a snowplow . for the kaspar sho-rack company , as long as newspapers are printed and sold , its machines will gladly continue to accept coins .:==:fewer customers buy from coin-operated newspaper machines . delivery man says newspapers sell better from train stations than street machines . texas company that makes the machines says business is down . `` there 'll be printed newspapers for years and years , '' firm 's president says .

oops , she did it again . some fans of britney spears are accusing the singer of lip-syncing to her song `` perfume '' during her las vegas show . according to gossip site oh no they did n't , spears ' mouth is moving but the audience is mostly hearing singer sia 's version of the track . billboard points out that sia -- best known for her hit song `` chandelier '' -- is credited as one of the writers of `` perfume . '' an acoustic version of the song as performed by sia is big on youtube . `` if you listen closely to the performance video , you can make out some of spears ' vocals under sia 's more charactered voice , '' colin stutz writes for billboard . `` that 's because , most likely , spears uses sia 's track as an in-monitor guide when she sings . only this time it was put into the house mix , making for an embarrassing accident . '' it 's not the first time spears has been called out for the vocalizations during her vegas show , which is part of a two-year residency . in reviewing the show for the los angeles times , writer mikael wood points out that the singer 's show appears to take its title , `` piece of me , '' literally . `` whatever the scale of the number ... the singer 's presence felt so diminished -- her dancing a tentative shadow of what it used to be , her vocals apparently lip-synced for the majority of the show -- as if to make the production 's title seem a taunt , '' wood writes . while her manager adam leber initially denied that spears was n't singing live during the show , he later backtracked during an interview with medium.com . `` to put on the show that she puts on , it 's virtually impossible to sing the entire time and do what she does , '' he said . `` she 's singing on every song , basically , when she has the ability to sing . there 's no way you can dance for 90 minutes straight and sing the entire time .
