-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the company that produced the peanut butter linked to a nationwide salmonella outbreak said late tuesday that it was voluntarily recalling all products made in its blakely , georgia , plant . salmonella bacteria are transmitted to humans by eating contaminated foods . the peanut corporation of america , a peanut processing company , made the peanut butter sold by king nut company . health officials in minnesota have said that salmonella they linked to an open container of king nut peanut butter was the same strain of bacteria responsible for the apparently ongoing outbreak , which has infected at least 434 people in 43 states . however , the king nut product is unlikely to be responsible for the entire outbreak , since it distributes its peanut butter only to food service companies in just seven states : ohio , minnesota , michigan , north dakota , arizona , idaho and new hampshire . so , the peanut corporation of america said it was voluntarily recalling all peanut butter produced in its blakely plant `` out of an abundance of caution . '' some of it is distributed to another company . what you need to know about food poisoning '' `` we deeply regret that this has happened , '' company president stewart parnell said . over the past few days , food and drug administration inspectors visited the blakely plant , where they took hundreds of samples for testing , parnell said . the salmonella outbreak has been spreading across much of the country since september . salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium played a role in the deaths of an elderly person from southwestern virginia and an adult from northern virginia . the third death was a nursing home resident in her 70s in minnesota . all three of the patients who died had underlying illnesses that could have contributed to their deaths , state officials said . the centers for disease control and prevention , in a written statement , has called peanut butter `` a likely source '' of the infections . but it said that no association had been found with common brand names of peanut butter sold in grocery stores . the first cases of salmonella were reported september 3 , but most occurred between october 1 and january 6 , the cdc said . about 18 percent of cases were hospitalized as a result of their illness , and patients have ranged from 2 months to 98 years of age . cdc spokeswoman lola russell said a preliminary analysis suggests peanut butter as a likely source of the outbreak . no cases connected to the outbreak have been reported in montana , new mexico , louisiana , mississippi , south carolina , florida or alaska . very young people , older people and those with compromised immune systems are most vulnerable to severe side effects of salmonella infection , including death , health officials have said . cnn 's miriam falco contributed to this report .:==:the peanut corp. of america recalls all products made in blakely , georgia , plant . peanut butter linked to salmonella outbreak has sickened 425 in 43 states . three deaths possibly linked to the outbreak ; two in virginia , one in minnesota .

from chicago , to georgia , to southern california , a new social media application is causing problems on middle school and high school campuses across the united states . it 's called yik yak , a location-based app that creates an anonymous social chat room where up to 500 nearby users connect through gps tracking on their phones . less than 4 months old , yik yak has `` a couple hundred thousand users , mainly in southeast/east coast campuses , '' its co-founder brooks buffington said . users are limited to 200 characters , and no pictures are allowed . if a post is `` down voted '' enough times by other users on the forum , the comment disappears . tech experts are comparing the new atlanta-based app to a cross between snapchat and twitter . `` the app was made for college-age users or above , for college campuses and to act as a virtual bulletin board , so it acts as local twitter for their campus , '' buffington told cnn . although the app is meant for users age 17 and older , younger users can still sign up , and that 's where the issues have sprouted . school administrators in chicago said teens in some of their schools have used the free app for cyberbullying . others have made anonymous bomb threats that have led to school lockdowns . `` students were actually coming downstairs to talk to administration , and they were mentioning remarks posted and student names that were obvious , so of course that is going to impact you , '' melvin soto , assistant vice principal at whitney young high school , told cnn affiliate wls . some students have compared it to a virtual bathroom wall where users post vitriol and hate . `` they ripped on someone for getting raped , and that 's just so wrong . they said a whole lot of bad things about this girl , '' whitney young student rachel brown told wls . in southern california , a san clemente high school resource officer told cnn a threatening yik yak post caused a bomb scare on campus . `` the school was placed on lockdown , we conducted a sweep utilizing our bomb squad and bomb-sniffing dogs and nothing suspicious was located on or near the campus , '' orange county sheriff 's spokesman jeff hallock told cnn . he added that the app is so new that some students had n't even heard about it yet . in georgia , the principal of webb bridge middle school in fulton county wrote a cautionary letter to parents warning them about the `` inflammatory -lsb- yik yak -rsb- app , '' encouraging them to talk to their children about the `` dangers of social media . '' the school district has blocked the app from its network , but principal susan opferman writes , students have found ways around that too . `` if used inappropriately , yik yak posts can be especially vicious and hurtful , since there is no way to trace their source , and can be disseminated widely , '' opferman said in the letter . these types of incidents have caused the app 's developers to disable it in some areas . buffington told cnn he does n't want high school students using the app . `` one of the things we were planning to do is to essentially geo-sense every high school and middle school in america , so if they try to open the app in their school , it will say something like ` no , no no , looks like you are trying to open the app on a high school or middle school and this is only for college kids , ' and it will disable it and the app wo n't work , '' buffington told cnn . `` that will completely eliminate the problem we have been seeing , so we geo-sensed the entire city of chicago until we get this fix up . we are working on getting third-party help to get the fix in place as soon as possible . '' but cyberbullying expert justin w. patchin says that 's just a short-term solution . he says teens will figure out a way around it . `` it is pretty impossible to limit it to the ages that the founders have intended , '' said patchin , who is the co-director at the cyberbullying research center at the university of wisconsin-eau claire . `` when i signed up for the app , it said that you have to be 17 or above to sign in , and of course , there was n't any way of them checking my age so anybody could sign up . '' the app 's developers defended their technology , saying it is used for good . `` with anonymity comes a lot of responsibility , and college kids have the maturity that it takes to handle those responsibilities , '' buffington said . `` one of my favorite use case stories is a freshman missed his flight for christmas break , and he came back to campus and he posted on yik yak that the freshman dorms were closed , and so an upperclassman let him crash on his couch , '' buffington said . `` anonymity can be a really beautiful thing , and one of the reasons we made it anonymous is it gives people a blank slate to work from , so you 're not judged on your race or sexuality or gender . on yik yak you are purely judged on content you create . '' buffington said . he added , `` the longer that we are around on college campuses , the better it gets . '' as more applications pop up and the environments of social networking sites change , patchin says the emphasis should be on teaching younger generations about respect in online communities . `` it is more important to talk to the students about how to treat each other respectfully . whether it is happening in an application like this or facebook or on e-mail , the emphasis for us has always been on those behaviors because it is easier to teach that than to restrict that to particular technology . '':==:yik yak creates an anonymous chat room of users connected by location . meant for colleges students , high schoolers have caught on , caused trouble . chicago schools report cyberbullying , and a california school reports a bomb scare . the app is useful for more mature college students , app 's co-founder says .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- salmonellosis is a nasty illness . people infected with salmonella develop diarrhea , a fever and abdominal cramps that usually last for four to seven days . the dangerous bacteria is found in the food we eat , usually chicken , beef or eggs that have been contaminated with animal feces . and a new report from pew charitable trusts says the u.s. department of agriculture 's food safety and inspection service -lrb- fsis -rrb- is n't doing enough to keep our food salmonella-free . `` when more than 500 people get sick from two outbreaks associated with chicken that meets federal safety standards , it is clear that those standards are not effectively protecting public health , '' sandra eskin , director of pew 's food safety project , said in a statement . every year , approximately 42,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported in the united states , according to the centers for disease control and prevention , but the actual number of infections may be much higher . the majority of outbreaks over the last two decades have been linked to live poultry . pew researchers specifically looked at two recent outbreaks that were connected to chicken produced by foster farms in california . between june 2012 and may 2013 , 134 people became infected with salmonella heidelberg -- mostly in oregon and washington , according to the cdc . tests identified the outbreak strain in four samples of chicken that were traced back to two foster farms slaughterhouses . then in the summer and fall of 2013 , 389 people in 23 states and puerto rico became sickened with varying strains of salmonella heidelberg . cdc investigators determined consumption of foster farms chicken was the likely source of the outbreak . `` in neither instance did fsis ask foster farms to institute a recall or stop shipping potentially contaminated chicken to market , '' the pew report authors wrote . no deaths were reported in either outbreak . the second outbreak is ongoing , according to the cdc , which updated its numbers thursday . an additional 27 people have fallen ill since november . the fsis acted as aggressively as possible under the authority they had during the foster farms outbreaks , said brian ronholm , usda 's deputy undersecretary for food safety . he said the usda `` appreciates '' pew 's report since it `` supports the efforts we already have under way . '' the government agency has a proposal under department review now that would require all poultry slaughterhouses to prevent contamination by conducting microbial testing at two points , ronholm said . it would also authorize inspectors to suspend operations in slaughter facilities that can not demonstrate they are controlling salmonella . in a separate paper , consumer reports said it found `` worrisome '' levels of bacteria in tests conducted on 316 chicken breasts , including 64 from brands that use no antibiotics in raising chickens and 24 organic samples . `` every one of the four major brands we tested contained worrisome amounts of bacteria , even the chicken breasts labeled ` no antibiotics ' or ` organic , ' '' consumer reports said . the most common bacteria found was enterococcus , a fecal contaminant , in 79.8 % . next was e. coli , in 65.2 % . campylobacter , salmonella and staphylococcus aureus were also present , according to the report . in response to consumer reports , the national chicken council said poultry producers spend tens of millions of dollars each year researching food safety , which has helped significantly decrease food-borne pathogens . `` americans eat about 160 million servings of chicken every single day , '' the council said in a statement , `` and 99.9 % of those servings are consumed safely . '' the usda does not require poultry plants to treat the presence of salmonella as a significant risk , according to the pew report , and has no standards for chicken parts , which are purchased more widely than whole chickens . fsis notifies facilities before conducting an investigation . even if tests show unsafe amounts of salmonella , the authors wrote , fsis can not close down the facility . salmonella is estimated to cause more than 1 million food-borne illnesses every year , according to the pew report , and health-related costs run as high as $ 11 billion yearly . the pew report makes several recommendations for improving usda 's `` salmonella action plan , '' which the agency posted earlier this month : -- change salmonella performance standards so they are updated regularly , enforceable and tied to public health outcomes . -- consider establishing limits on the amount of salmonella that can be present in chickens as they enter slaughterhouses . -- conduct unannounced testing in poultry producing facilities . -- close plants that are under investigation and keep them closed until `` adequate control measures are in place . '' `` the contaminated product is n't supposed to reach consumers -- that 's the point , '' eskin said . `` you see this is a very complicated bacteria . it 's a challenge , and we have n't gotten it right yet . '' ronholm could not offer a time frame for when the fsis food safety proposal may go into effect . he said it 's important for consumers to remain diligent about food safety practices , including washing their hands and cooking food to the right temperatures .:==:salmonella causes diarrhea , fever and abdominal cramps for 4 to 7 days . pew report says usda is n't doing enough to keep our food free from the bacteria . report authors looked at two recent outbreaks linked to foster farms chicken .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- for observers of latin america , this week 's meeting in caracas between venezuelan president hugo chavez and colombian president juan manuel santos was remarkable for how unremarkable it was . santos and chavez , both in suits , sat closely at a table as they signed a number of bilateral initiatives on agriculture , trade and security . before last year , the thought of colombia and venezuela cooperating on anything at all seemed remote . relations were so strained between the two countries that the word `` war '' was on politicians ' lips . chavez and santos ' predecessor , alvaro uribe , volleyed insults back and forth like professional tennis players . the relationship has healed much since then , but analysts say that old wounds remain near the surface . distrust had poisoned the relationship between the neighbors -- uribe accused venezuela of creating a haven for guerrillas ; chavez accused colombia of creating a haven for the u.s. military . when santos -- uribe 's hardline defense minister -- was elected president , he was expected to continue his policies , and he has , with one big exception . `` when santos was elected , we thought this was it for venezuela , but after the election , he took some real steps to patch things up , '' said adam isacson , a colombia expert and senior associate at the washington office on latin america . in august of last year , santos and chavez agreed to put the hostilities aside . `` starting at zero , '' santos called it . `` i 'm here to turn the page , '' chavez said . `` one thing they agreed to do was cooperate more on the farc presence in venezuela and it 's a real debate on what 's actually been done , '' isacson said , referring to the revolutionary armed forces of colombia , a guerrilla group . santos has vouched for a venezuelan claim that all farc encampments located in venezuela have been dismantled , but the true test of cooperation will come now that the farc has a new leader . rodrigo londono echeverri , also known as timoleon jimenez and timochenko , is the new farc head after its former chief was killed in a military operation last month . colombia has specifically named londono as a guerrilla that lives in venezuela . he is believed to cross the border between the two countries freely , isacson said . how strongly venezuela goes after londono could be an indicator of how deep these new ties are . nonetheless , even talk of cooperation is a world away from the atmosphere two years ago . in november 2009 , chavez ordered his military to begin preparations for a war with colombia , warning of a conspiracy between colombia and the united states to attack venezuela . colombia called the announcement a `` war threat , '' and venezuela retorted by calling colombia 's response `` hypocritical '' and `` immoral . '' eight months later , venezuela broke off all diplomatic relations with colombia . so when santos and chavez decided to be friends , `` most of the region let out a huge sigh of relief because of it , '' isacson said . but from his perspective , the relationship is `` fragile , and it remains fragile , '' he said . the friendship between the two leaders also speaks to the pragmatism of each , said michael shifter , president of the inter-american dialogue . unlike uribe , santos has aspirations to be a regional leader , and cordial relations with venezuela make it possible for colombia to become less isolated from other south american countries , he said . also , by cooperating with chavez , there is probably the expectation of more progress against the farc , shifter said . and cooperation has shown some rewards in the shape of increased trade , reduced tensions and some high-level captures . during their meeting monday , the leaders announced that venezuela had captured maximiliano bonilla orozco , one of colombia 's most-wanted drug traffickers . `` this shows that if we work together , if our police enforcement work together , we will get better results , '' santos said . chavez added , `` we will do everything we can to stop any attacks from venezuelan soil into colombia . '' there is a sense of pragmatism on both sides , it appears , but mistrust has ruined that before . `` the relationship is based on mutual interest , but i do n't think the trust goes very deep on either side , '' shifter said . other challenges exist as well . chavez 's health -- he underwent treatment for cancer this year -- has kept the two leaders from meeting often , isacson said . their meeting this week was the first in seven months . also , shifter points out , chavez is unpredictable and colombia makes an easy target . `` they are very , very close in many areas . that 's made for a complicated relationship , '' he said . for now , at least , chavez summed up his view like this on monday : `` we can be an example of how governments with different views ... -lrb- can -rrb- put those differences aside and put forth a single direction , a single compass . '':==:for a period , venezuela and colombia were bitterly at odds . in the past year that relationship has healed . obstacles to the strength of that relationship remain , analysts say .
