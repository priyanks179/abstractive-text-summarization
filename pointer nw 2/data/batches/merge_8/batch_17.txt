-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a rebel group now in control of a key city in eastern democratic republic of the congo announced wednesday that it plans to `` liberate '' the entire country . cnn ireport : desperate situation as families flee , says charity a spokesman for the rebel m23 group said its successful operation to take goma on tuesday , the culmination of several days of heavy fighting against government forces , was just the beginning . `` we will push on to bukavu , then kisangani , and finally take kinshasa and overthrow the government , '' lt. col. vianney kazarama said to enthusiastic cheers from a crowd of several hundred at goma 's stadium , according to a congolese reporter there . kazarama said that once the rebels overthrow the government , they will call for elections . rebels seize control of goma amid clashes in democratic republic of congo kinshasa , the country 's capital , lies nearly 1,000 miles to the west of goma , the capital of north kivu province . on wednesday , m23 consolidated its control of goma , calling on policemen and the remaining government soldiers in town to integrate with the rebel group . activity started to return to normal , with shop owners restarting their businesses -- some after closing their doors for several days because of the tense situation . m23 has called on schools and banks to reopen as early as thursday . the front line , according to the rebel fighters , has moved to the west of goma , to mugunga . the u.n. special representative for dr congo , roger meece , briefed the u.n. security council on the `` extremely serious crisis '' in north kivu by video link from kinshasa on wednesday . `` the security situation in north kivu as well as in other areas in the east of congo has seriously deteriorated over recent days , and this is compounded by a vast humanitarian crisis affecting hundreds of thousands of congolese citizens , '' meece said . he also warned that violent protests against the congolese authorities , as well as u.n. facilities and its staff , might spread to other parts of the country . the m23 's occupation of goma and another nearby town , sake , had been in the face of `` significant resistance '' by the congolese army , supported by monusco , the u.n. mission in dr congo , he said . the rebels were initially held in check but were able to come back with `` sophisticated tactics , '' he said , with their capabilities apparently bolstered by `` external support . '' `` as we have seen in other areas occupied by m23 , the occupation of goma also poses a major risk of increased serious human rights violations , including killings and forced conscription of civilians , including minors , '' meece said . the united nations has already received numerous reports of targeted summary executions of those who try to stand in the rebels ' way , he said , and there is an increased threat of sexual violence . meece said he believed it was possible to roll back the rebels ' gains and restore stability , but only with a strong commitment from the international community . the u.n. security council backed a resolution tuesday calling for sanctions against the rebel leadership and `` those providing external support to the m23 . '' the united nations and some donor countries have accused neighboring rwanda of backing the m23 by providing it with arms , support and even soldiers . rwandan president paul kagame has repeatedly denied the allegation . cnn ireporter aimee manimani , an aid worker with humanitarian group world vision , told of her grief as renewed violence in gisenye , just outside goma , forced her to flee across the border to rwanda . `` yesterday , when i heard the sounds of the bombs and mortar , i just got depressed . i started crying . i could n't control myself . i had to leave home again , '' she said . `` like most of my congolese , i feel humiliated by everything that we are forced to go through . i feel disgusted to leave everything behind and flee ... we had a normal life ; we could face poverty and many other difficulties ; we could manage all with the hope that everything will be fine one day . `` but now we must flee . parents and children have to hide under the bed , in the bushes or wherever they would feel safe . now thousands of parents ca n't even protect their children ... this makes me very sad . '' u.s. state department spokeswoman victoria nuland said tuesday that the united states was `` gravely alarmed by the rapid deterioration of the security situation in eastern drc '' and that it supported the u.n. security council 's call for additional sanctions against the m23 and its backers . security analysts say the rebellion in eastern dr congo has dangerous regional implications , including the risk that it could lead to renewed conflict with neighboring rwanda . civilians are also suffering , observers say . though 1,500 united nations peacekeeping troops are in goma and have control of the airport there , a u.n. spokesman said late tuesday that the situation is at a `` critical stage . '' `` reports indicate that the m23 has wounded civilians , is continuing abductions of children and women , is destroying property and is intimidating journalists and those who have attempted to resist their control , '' said eduardo del buey , the deputy spokesman for the u.n. secretary-general . a total of 6,000 troops from monusco are in the wider region of north and south kivu , patrolling areas of particular insecurity , del buey said . the united nations , the african union and countries in the region are demanding that m23 immediately stop its attacks , del buey said . france and britain also expressed their concerns tuesday . the british foreign office said its minister for africa , mark simmonds , was traveling to rwanda , dr congo and uganda to support efforts to end the crisis . the eastern part of dr congo , which includes goma , has been embroiled in violence since 1994 , when hutu forces crossed the border from rwanda fearing reprisals following the genocide . soldiers from the m23 group were part of the national army as part of peace negotiations brokered in 2009 . they broke away from the congolese army in april , however , complaining of a lack of pay and poor conditions . tens of thousands of congolese , already displaced by previous rounds of fighting in the volatile region , have fled camps around the edges of goma , according to unicef and the medical charity doctors without borders . cnn 's christina zdanowicz , mick krever and jamie crawford contributed to this report .:==:new : u.n special representative for dr congo warns of `` vast humanitarian crisis '' . new : a congolese aid worker tells of sorrow as civilians are forced to flee the violence . a rebel spokesman says m23 fighters plan to push on to kinshasa , capital of dr congo . the u.n. security council backs a resolution calling for sanctions against rebel leaders .

-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- just like some u.s. officials looking into the mystery , the man who captured video of an apparent fireball plunging from the sky over texas on sunday is perplexed about what it was . video captured in austin , texas , shows a meteor-like object in the sky sunday morning . `` i do n't know what i saw in the sky . it was something burning and falling really fast , '' eddie garcia , a videographer for news 8 austin , told cnn monday . `` i 'm looking in the viewfinder and i see , just , something flying through the sky . and it kind of looks like it could be dust , it could be something , and then i look up and , no , it was something burning in the sky , '' he said . `` and you know , this is something that you see at night clearly during a meteor shower or something like that , but you do n't see something like that during the day . '' authorities in texas said there were reports of sonic booms in the area sunday as well . watch video of meteor-like fireball '' early speculation was that it might have been debris from two satellites -- one american , one russian -- that rammed into each other in space a week ago . but the u.s. strategic command , which tracks satellite debris , said it was not . `` there is no correlation between those reports and any of that debris from the collision , '' command spokeswoman maj. regina winchester told cnn monday . so what was it ? `` i do n't know , '' she responded . `` it 's possible it was some kind of natural phenomenon , maybe a meteor . '' meteor fireballs bright enough to be seen in the daytime are rare but not unheard of . two of the most recent fell in october in the alice springs region of australia and last june just west of salt lake city , utah . the one over australia was unique because the asteroid that caused it was discovered and tracked before it reached earth 's atmosphere , according to the sydney observatory 's web site . it says the asteroid was about 6.5 feet wide . a sonic boom also was heard in connection with that event , the australian observatory says . on friday , the national weather service reported that its office in jackson , kentucky , had received calls about `` possible explosions '' or `` earthquakes '' in that area . `` the federal aviation administration has reported to local law enforcement that these events are being caused by falling satellite debris , '' the service said friday . `` these pieces of debris have been causing sonic booms , resulting in the vibrations being felt by some residents , as well as flashes of light across the sky . the cloud of debris is likely the result of the recent in-orbit collision of two satellites on tuesday february 10 , when kosmos 2251 crashed into iridium 33 . '' cnn 's call monday to nasa to get its take on the fireball over texas was not immediately returned . garcia said he had been told nasa may have called him . the faa had asked pilots saturday to keep an eye out for `` falling space debris , '' warning that `` a potential hazard may occur due to re-entry of satellite debris into the earth 's atmosphere . '' faa spokesman roland herwig said sunday there had been no reports of ground strikes or interference with aircraft in flight . he said the faa had received no reports from pilots in the air of any sightings , but had gotten `` numerous '' calls from people on the ground in texas , from dallas south to austin . as of monday morning , herwig said his agency had no information about what the fireball was . ireport.com : did you see the fireball ? send photos , video he also said the faa had rescinded its warning to pilots to look out for space debris . garcia , the videographer , was out covering a marathon race sunday morning when he caught a glimpse of the blaze . in the video , it appear as a meteor-like white fireball blazing across the clear sky . `` i remember shooting it and wondering what i shot , and then looking around and seeing if anyone saw it with me , and everyone was just focused on that marathon that we were shooting at the time , '' he told cnn newsroom . whatever it was , garcia said he 's `` just grateful i got a shot of it . and , hopefully , that 'll help '' people figure out what it was .:==:video shot in austin , texas , shows meteor-like object in sky sunday morning . fireball sightings , reports of sonic booms come days after satellite collision in space . faa told u.s. pilots to watch for `` falling space debris '' .

china has around two million people policing public opinion online , according to a state media report that sheds light on the country 's secretive internet surveillance operations . dubbed `` public opinion analysts , '' they work for the chinese communist party 's propaganda department , major chinese news websites and commercial corporations , according to the beijing news . using keyword searches , their job is to sift the millions of messages being posted on popular social media and microblogging sites such as sina weibo , regarded as china 's equivalent to twitter . they then compile reports for decision makers , the report said . the number of people monitoring internet activity to prevent criticism of the government and social unrest has been a subject of discussion for years , said david bandurski , editor of the university of hong kong 's china media project . `` two million sounds like a big number , '' he said . `` but i think it 's clear that the government will do what it takes to monitor any potential collective action on social media . '' the ranks of online censors outnumber china 's active armed forces , which total 1.5 million , according to the ministry of national defense . bandurski said that the resources china has invested in internet surveillance have increased rapidly since sina weibo 's emergence in 2010 . it now has 500 million account holders although a recent crackdown on internet rumors has deterred some users . posts run a range of topics from celebrity gossip to politically sensitive issues like official corruption . `` china 's biggest engineering project is not the three gorges dam but public opinion and weibo has completely changed the game , '' bandurski said . the beijing news described the work of tang xiaotao , who has been employed as a monitor for less than six months by a company that works on government projects . using a software application that cost $ 3 million yuan -lrb- $ 490,000 -rrb- , tang searches for key words specified by his company 's clients , monitors negative opinions and then compiles a report . the software also tracks how widely a topic is being discussed by counting the number of comments and shares . when the score reaches 40 out of 100 , the system will send an alert . a final decision on what action to take is decided by the clients , which include government officials , tang told the newspaper . online analysts like tang will be offered specialist training later this month , the newspaper said . the course , run by the people 's daily online operations , covers judging and analyzing online posts and dealing with crisis situations . those who pass will get a certificate , formally recognizing them as `` public opinion analysts .

washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- members of the military may get expedited treatment at airport security checkpoints under a law signed tuesday by president obama . the law , authored by rep. chip cravaack , r-minnesota , requires the transportation security administration to study ways to speed up screening of service members and , to the extent possible , their families , when the service members are in uniform and traveling on orders . cravaack , a 24-year navy veteran and former northwest airlines pilot , was inspired to introduce the bill after witnessing a soldier remove his boots while going through security at the minneapolis-st . paul airport . `` it seemed way too excessive for someone who was obviously a patriot serving his country , '' said the congressman 's spokesman , michael bars . the new law was signed just days after two incidents involving the same soldier at airports in north carolina and texas . according to court records , trey scott atwater , a 30-year-old army green beret , had a military smoke grenade in his bag when he was leaving fayetteville , north carolina , on christmas eve headed for texas . he was allowed to continue on his trip . on saturday , he was arrested at midland international airport in texas on his return trip when tsa screeners found an undisclosed amount of c-4 explosives in his bag . authorities said atwater did not have a detonator and initiator , that it would not have been possible to detonate the explosives , and that it did not appear he was up to anything nefarious . it was not immediately clear how any checkpoint changes would impact cases like atwater 's . bars said the new law is intended to expedite screening , but not reduce security . currently , the tsa expedites screening for trusted travelers by dedicating a special line for them , and by allowing them to keep their shoes on and keep laptops in their carry-on bags . the new law says the tsa should establish guidelines for screening travelers in military uniforms and combat boots , and consider incorporating military personnel into trusted traveler programs that give preference to passengers who undergo pre-screening . nothing in the law prohibits additional screening of the service member if intelligence or law enforcement information indicates that additional screening is necessary . in november , tsa administrator john pistole told cnn that he was already working on ways to expedite screening for service members . the tsa was starting to tests its ability to scan military id cards , known as `` common access cards , '' at a regional airport in monterey , ca . pistole said the tsa test would not immediately result in quicker screening for service members . but if tests are successful , `` we hope to expand that to airports that would have a large number of military personnel traveling through them , '' he said . supporters of the initiative said that by expediting the screening of military personnel , the tsa will have more time to focus on unknown travelers who could present a higher risk .

san diego -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- even for someone who has written more than 2,000 columns over the last 20 years , sometimes the words come out wrong . all i know is that my wife is angry . `` you need to fix this ! '' she says , as she holds up her smartphone . on the screen is a copy of my latest column for cnn.com scolding a faction of the dreamers , the undocumented youth angling for legal status , for what i -- and judging from the response , quite a few other americans -- see as a sense of entitlement . `` i hated this column , '' she said . `` i know what you were trying to say , because i know you . but other people wo n't understand it . they 're confused and angry , and they should be . i get your point . you 're saying that these kids have become entitled and self-important like other kids and they 're going to blow it for everyone else -- including their undocumented parents . but that 's not what you walk away from this column with . what you walk way with is meanness . and that 's not you . '' bah humbug . sometimes , it is me . as i often tell audiences that gather for my speeches , constantly cheerful and positive writers work for hallmark . and yet , i notice that many of my critics on the left who think the tone of the dreamer piece was harsh did n't object when , in the past , i lashed out in a similar tone against those on the right . when voters turned out arizona state sen. russell pearce , the major sponsor of that state 's dreadful immigration law , i wrote that `` evil has left the building . '' when mitt romney was overheard telling donors that he 'd have a better shot at winning the presidential election if he were latino , i mocked the republican candidate for `` playing the victim '' because he had the `` misfortune to be born a white male . '' in another column , after romney blamed his defeat on minorities who were hungry for giveaways , i called him a `` loser . '' and , when writing about the intersection of immigration and politics , i have had no trouble saying that the gop brand is toxic to latinos because the party has chosen to `` pander to racists and nativists . '' every time , conservatives were upset , but -- on facebook and other social media -- liberals applauded . could it be that what really troubles people is n't the tone of a particular column but who is being skewered ? still , as a mexican immigrant herself , my wife has a point . and so do many of my critics . in the offending column , i was not trying to describe the individual lives of the estimated 1.4 million undocumented high school and college students in the united states . everyone is different . i was talking about a movement , a political strategy that involves dreamers demanding what they see as their `` rights '' and , in the process , succumbing to a radicalism that is counterproductive and threatens to torpedo immigration reform for millions of others . like the saying goes , you catch more flies with honey than ... by donning a cap and gown and occupying the office of a member of congress until you 're arrested . or something like that . but people did n't hear that message . they drew upon their own frame of reference and , thinking back to dreamers they know , declared that they were swell folks who were humble and idealistic and did n't feel entitled . so , they said , i must be wrong . ironically , some of those who reacted angrily to the column wound up making its point . one reader , who identified himself as a dreamer who has lived in the united states for 11 years , insisted that he and his cohort were n't making demands . then he added : `` speaking for myself ... at this point i am done asking . i demand to be fully incorporated into this society . '' now there 's a lack of self-awareness . yet , that 's also a good trait for columnists , who can always say things better and clearer . so let 's try this again . for those undocumented youth who think that america owes them a fulfillment of their dreams , or who -- like the reader -- demand to be fully `` incorporated into this society , '' that first column was for you . and the scolding fits . but for the rest of you who work hard and obey the law and keep your head down and just want to find a way to live legally in a country you consider your own and where you 've lived most of your life , let me first apologize for lumping you together with the demanders . then let me give you some friendly advice : -- think critically . it 's not enough to have beliefs . you have to constantly challenge yourselves so you know why you believe it , and can defend it . because someday , you 'll have to do so ; -- privileges are not rights , and so they are earned and not granted by our creator . if congress gives you the privilege of legal status , you need to decide what you 're prepared to give in return . you need a plan , and a demand is not a plan ; -- focus on deeds not words , and admit that neither political party has been courageous or honest on immigration . so do n't feel beholden to either . power comes from exercising options . shop around ; -lrb- last week , the obama administration released figures showing that immigration and customs enforcement broke its own record for total number of deportations . the agency removed 409,849 illegal immigrants in the 2012 fiscal year , compared to 396,906 in the 2011 fiscal year and 392,000 in the 2010 fiscal year . as most dreamers would agree , those numbers are nothing to be proud of , especially since they appear to be driven by politics . -rrb- -- challenge your friends with the same amount of enthusiasm that you challenge your foes . after all , in the world of politics and beyond , those you support owe you something for standing by them . make sure you collect ; and -- accept that , while it 's true that you did nothing wrong when you were brought here as a child , someone along the line , someone in your family tree broke a law . they crossed a border without permission , or overstayed a visa . deal with it . before we can legalize your status , you have to accept the wrong that was done and someone has to make amends for it -- if not you , then the person who broke the rules . above all , always try to be better people who strive for fairness , listen to different points of view , and take responsibility for your words and deeds . and i 'll do the same . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of ruben navarrette .:==:ruben navarrette : in my previous column i scolded a faction of the dreamers . navarrette said they have a sense of entitlement , and many readers feel the same , he says . many readers were offended , including his wife , says navarrette . he says he was talking about people succumbing to a counterproductive radicalism .

hong kong -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- while only the highest echelons of north korea 's opaque leadership will know the full financial cost of wednesday 's launch , south korea 's government estimates pyongyang spent $ 1.3 billion on its rocket program this year . the two rockets launched this year -- this week 's mission and a failed attempt in april -- cost $ 600 million , while the launch site itself is estimated at $ 400 million . other related facilities add another $ 300 million , according to an official from south korea 's ministry of unification . `` this is equivalent to acquiring 4.6 million tons of corn , '' the official said . `` if this was used for solving the food shortage issue , north koreans would not have to worry about food for four to five years . '' whatever the cost , what is known is that north korea is one of the poorest countries in asia , with an economy worth just $ 40 billion , according to the cia world factbook . but the price of north korea 's rocket launches might be lower than government estimates because north korean workers earn much less than their southern neighbors , says cheong wook-sik , director of south korea 's peace network in seoul . the kaesong industrial complex , on the border with south korea , has some of the country 's highest wage earners at about $ 100 per month , says cheong , 14-year chief of the south korean non-governmental organization . `` this is very high compared to the rest of north korea . if you 're not working in kaesong , the average worker salary drops to an average of perhaps $ 50 per month . '' prior to wednesday 's launch , south korea threatened tougher sanctions on north korea in the footsteps of a 2007 freeze on north korean funds held at banco delta asia in the chinese territory of macau . cheong says some $ 25 million are still frozen there -- illicit funds from money laundering and drug trafficking by the north korean regime . `` but in order to impose further sanctions , china 's involvement is necessary '' because beijing is pyongyang 's closest ally in the world , cheong said . `` i do n't think financial sanctions against north korea are the best course of action because that can make the situation out of control . '' but the financial cost and any risk of further sanctions may be a tradeoff for internal political gain as leader kim jong-un tries to solidify his grip on power , as wednesday 's launch comes near the first-year death anniversary of his father , kim jong-il , on december 17 . read more : what does north korea 's planned rocket launch mean ? indeed , cheong believes the main audience for wednesday 's rocket launch is north korea 's own citizens -- not the rest of the world . `` if north korea succeeds in launching a satellite , north korea propaganda may spin this by saying the country has become a prosperous and strong nation . that will help kim jong-un both consolidate his power and help maintain the legacy of his father . '' if there is a message to the international community , adds cheong , it may be that north korea is implying `` our satellite launch means we have nuclear weapons , we have a delivery system . '' timeline : north korea 's rocket-fueled obsession cnn 's kj kwon contributed to this report from seoul:==:south korea : cost of pyongyang 's two rocket launches estimated at $ 1.3 billion . north korea appears to have successfully launched a rocket after a failed april mission . official : cost of 2012 rocket program could feed north koreans for `` four to five years '' . analyst : main audience for wednesday 's rocket launch is north korea 's own citizens .
